# Waitlist API

A sophisticated RESTful API for managing appointments between users and service providers with an advanced queue system that prioritizes reliable users.

## 📋 Overview

The Waitlist API provides a streamlined system for booking and managing appointments between users and service accounts. It features an intelligent queue system that automatically prioritizes users based on their reliability history.

### Core Features

- **User & Service Management**: Complete user and service provider (service account) management
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, cancel, complete, and track appointments
- **Intelligent Waitlist System**: Queue prioritization based on user reliability
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with Pydantic
- **Standardized Response Format**: Consistent API responses with proper error handling
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic

## 🏗️ Data Model

The API uses a simplified and intuitive data model:

1. **Users**: Regular users who can book appointments
2. **Service Accounts**: Special type of user that provides services
3. **Appointments**: Bookings between users and service accounts

This streamlined model simplifies the previous concept that had separate entities for services and providers.

## ⚙️ Waitlist System

The API implements a sophisticated waitlist system with the following features:

- **One Appointment Per Day**: Users can only have one active appointment per day for a specific service
- **Day-Based Scheduling**: Appointments are booked for specific days, not exact times
- **Reliability Penalty System**: Users who have a history of cancellations or no-shows receive a higher penalty value
- **Priority Ranking**: The waitlist for each service is automatically ranked by:
  1. User reliability (lower penalty = higher priority)
  2. Appointment creation time (earlier = higher priority)
- **No-Show Impact**: No-shows have a greater impact on future penalties than cancellations

### User Reliability and Penalties

The system calculates a reliability penalty for each user when they create a new appointment:

- New users start with a penalty of 0.0 (perfect reliability)
- The penalty is based on the user's entire appointment history with that specific service:
  - Number of cancellations, no-shows, and successfully completed appointments
  - Cancellations and no-shows are weighted differently based on service settings
  - Completed appointments positively affect reliability
  - Weights are automatically normalized to ensure the penalty stays within 0-1 range
- Lower penalties get higher priority in the waitlist
- Penalties are calculated at appointment creation time and stay with the appointment for historical tracking

#### Penalty Calculation

The penalty is calculated using a sophisticated formula that considers both the user's complete appointment history and the recency of events:

```python
# Weight normalization
normalized_cancellation_weight = cancellation_weight / (cancellation_weight + no_show_weight)
normalized_no_show_weight = no_show_weight / (cancellation_weight + no_show_weight)

# Rate calculations
cancellation_rate = total_cancellations / total_appointments
no_show_rate = total_no_shows / total_appointments

# Penalty calculation steps
base_penalty = (cancellation_rate * normalized_cancellation_weight + 
                no_show_rate * normalized_no_show_weight)
                
adjusted_penalty = base_penalty * (0.7 + 0.3 * recency_penalty)

reliability_score = adjusted_penalty * volume_factor
```

The recency penalty is calculated using an exponential decay function that gives more weight to recent appointment behavior:

```python
recency_weight = math.exp(-0.023 * days_ago)
```

This formula provides several advantages:
- Considers both frequency and recency of cancellations and no-shows
- Applies different weights to cancellations and no-shows based on service account preferences
- Gives more weight to recent behavior through exponential decay
- Normalizes weights to ensure consistent scoring regardless of weight magnitude
- Ensures the final score stays within 0-1 range

#### Customizable Penalty System

Service accounts can customize how penalties are calculated:

- **Enable/Disable Penalties**: Service accounts can opt out of the penalty system entirely. When disabled, all users have equal priority (penalty = 0.0).
- **Cancellation Weight**: How much a cancellation impacts the user's penalty calculation (default: 1.0)
- **No-Show Weight**: How much a no-show impacts the user's penalty calculation (default: 2.0)

These weights allow service accounts to tailor the queue prioritization to their specific business needs.

## 🔄 Appointment Status Flow

Appointments follow this status progression:

1. **ACTIVE**: Initial state when created
2. **CANCELED**: When explicitly canceled by user or staff
3. **COMPLETED**: When service has been provided
4. **NO_SHOW**: When user doesn't attend the appointment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Git

### Installation

#### Option 1: Running Locally with Python

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waitlist-api.git
cd waitlist-api
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Unix/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Start the API server**:
```bash
# Development env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Production env
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Option 2: Running with Docker

The project includes a Makefile for simplified Docker operations:

```bash
make dev      # Start in development mode
make prod     # Start in production mode
make down     # Stop containers
make cleanup  # Stop and remove containers
make logs     # View logs
make rebuild  # Rebuild and restart containers
```

### Migrating from Previous Version

If upgrading from a previous version, run the migration script:

```bash
python -m app.migrate_data
```

This will convert existing services and providers to the new service account model.
